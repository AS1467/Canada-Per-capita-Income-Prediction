# Canada-Per-capita-Income-Prediction
This project is a simple machine learning exercise to predict Canada's per capita income based on historical data. The dataset used in this project was sourced from the CodeBasics GitHub repository and is used here to practice linear regression as part of my machine learning learning process.
